# Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework

## 📌 Project Title
Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework

---

## 🧾 Introduction

This project focuses on modernizing the legacy Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system of IRCTC into a cloud-based, AI-driven Conversational IVR framework.

Traditional IVR systems rely heavily on DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) keypad input and rigid menu-based navigation. These systems lack personalization, scalability, and natural user interaction.

This project proposes a scalable conversational architecture using cloud telephony and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance user experience and operational efficiency.

## 🏢 Organization Context

The system is designed considering the operations of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), which handles millions of railway ticket bookings and customer inquiries daily.

Due to high traffic and peak-hour loads, a modern intelligent IVR system is essential to reduce call handling time and improve service quality.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze the existing legacy IVR architecture
- Identify limitations in traditional DTMF-based systems
- Gather functional and non-functional requirements
- Design a scalable conversational IVR architecture
- Improve customer interaction using voice-based AI
- Provide a roadmap for modernization

## 🏗️ Proposed Modern Architecture

The modern system consists of the following components:

1. Caller (PSTN / VoIP)
2. Twilio Voice Gateway
3. Speech-to-Text Engine
4. Dialogflow CX (Conversational AI Engine)
5. Intent Detection & Entity Extraction
6. Backend Fulfillment (Node.js Webhook)
7. IRCTC Backend Service Integration
8. Text-to-Speech Engine
9. Agent Escalation Module

The system replaces rigid keypad navigation with natural language conversation handling.
